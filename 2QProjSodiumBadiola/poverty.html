           Poverty, descended from the latin word "pauper" meaning "poor", is commonly defined by having a high lack of the material ability to be able to have basic material 
		   needs and be able to make decisive impact on your life, with the extreme version of it being a heightened loss of most of this. It is commonly measured in absolute 
		   poverty and relative poverty, with absolute relating to the needs of a specific family and relative measuring the family's wealth (or lack thereof) with other 
		   families in the same country, to see if theirs is below average. It can be caused due to a variety of reasons, and it results in a wide variety of problems ranging 
		   from malnourishment to severe human rights violations, which is incredibly tragic as many people still live in poverty and extreme poverty today.
