            <p> 
			Homelessness, similar to poverty, is usually categorized as a lack of a home -- a shelter where one is safe and their needs are fulfiled. It has multiple categories, 
			and in the broadest sense about 1/7th of the world is homeless due to inadequate housing, with approximately at least 150 million people living without a house.
